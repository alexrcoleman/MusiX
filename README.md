MusiX v1.02
==============

Your standard program for downloading legally bought music from video sites.
Instructions for Quarry
--------------

Click the **MusiX.jar** file, and then click the **Raw** button on that page. Also, if the last update for the .jar file is ever older than the last update for any other files (you can see the last update for a file on the homepage on the right), tell me and I'll push an update to the .jar file (I might make changes and forget to export it to the jar)

Also, the readme tells you the latest version number, so you can check and make sure that matches the one at the top of your program. If not, download the new version!
