# MusiX v1.0.4 #
Your standard program for downloading legally bought music from video sites.

## Setup ##
Click the **MusiX.jar** file, and then click the **Raw** button on that page. Also, if the last update for the .jar file is ever older than the last update for any other files (you can see the last update for a file on the homepage on the right), tell me and I'll push an update to the .jar file (I might make changes and forget to export it to the jar)

Also, the readme tells you the latest version number, so you can check and make sure that matches the one at the top of your program. If not, download the new version!

## Newest Features ##
* Metadata (information about the song like title and lyrics) will automatically write to the file before closing or adding to iTunes, so once all the information is added you don't have to wait for it to save
* Lyrics and album information will be searched for once using the title/artist detected from the youtube video title, and again when the **Scrape Metadata** button is pressed. If you change the title/artist, you can click this to update.
* You can now use the up and down arrow keys to cycle through different autocompletion options (ex. typing h gives "hotline bling", pressing down gives "hello adele". Press up again to get back to "hotline bling")
