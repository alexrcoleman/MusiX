Instructions for Quarry
--------------

Click the **MusiX.jar** file, and then click the **Raw** button on that page. Also on the homepage, if the last update for the .jar file is ever older than the last update for any other files, tell me and I'll push an update to the .jar file (I might make changes and forget to export it to the jar)
